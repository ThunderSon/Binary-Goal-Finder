# Binary-Goal-Finder
The Binary Goal Finder will allow you to know the path to your goal in a tree that can be tracked in binary.

A tree with state K will have 2 successors, 2K and 2K+1.

Consider going from K to 2K as Left, and to 2K+1 as Right.
This program will give you the path you have to go through to get to your goal.
e.g. If your goal is at node 12, your path will be Right, Left, Left.
